# flockingAlgorithmPy

This is my implementation of the Boids flocking behavior algorithm in Python

Using:
pygame for display
a quadtree data structure for holding entities and positions

Have pulled a lot of inspiration from this implementation:
[https://github.com/meznak/boids_py](https://github.com/meznak/boids_py)

There seem to be something dragging the "boids" towards the top left corner of the screen.\
However I have not found out what it is yet...
